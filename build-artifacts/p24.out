He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast.”  – Confucius, Ensign

Such shows the lack of self-discipline and self-determination.”  – Gilbert M. Holloway, Ensign
“I want you to teach the people -- and I want you to follow this counsel yourself -- that they must labor and live so as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles and as elders in the church and kingdom of God.”  – Brigham Young, The Missionary's Little Quote Book

What is your experience? It is the same as my own. You cannot constantly be sinning a little and repenting, and retain the Spirit of the Lord as your constant companion.

Nothing short of that would ever do.”  – Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses

“If we will be submissive and listen to the revelations of the Most High, remembering that His ways are not as our ways, and His thoughts as our thoughts, for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are His ways than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts; if we will remember this, and act upon it, we are in the way to obtain those keys of power, and profit by them; that is to say, we are right on the grand turnpike to exaltation.”  – George Albert Smith, Journal of Discourses
“It is not position, it is not education that gives the Spirit of God; but it is keeping the commandments of Almighty God and being lowly in heart and desiring to fulfill the commandments of God in our daily walk and conversation.

No man will fail who is doing his duty in this Church.”  – Heber J. Grant, CR

“Those engaged in seeking the outcasts of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah, cannot fail to enjoy the Spirit of the Lord and have the choicest blessings of Heaven rest upon them in copious effusions. . .

They may try to preach the mysteries and to present something strange, great, and wonderful, and they may labor for this with all their might, in the spirit and strength of man without the aid of the Holy Spirit of God, and yet the people are not edified, and their preaching will not give much satisfaction. It is the plainest and the most simple things that edify us the most, if taught by the Spirit of God; and there is nothing more important or beneficial unto us.”  – Wilford Woodruff, Discourses of Wilford Woodruff
“Inspiration comes of working every day.”  – Charles Baudelaire, Discourses of Wilford Woodruff

“Faith must be enforced by reason. When faith becomes blind it dies.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, Discourses of Wilford Woodruff
