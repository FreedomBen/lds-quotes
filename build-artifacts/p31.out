“The success of this life is not measured at the end of it by what we have, but rather by what we are.”  – Rulon S. Wells, General Conference
“A striking personality and good character is achieved by practice, not merely by thinking it. Just as a pianist masters the intricacies of music through hours and weeks of practice, so mastery of life is achieved by the ceaseless practice of mechanics which make up the art of living. Daily unselfish service to others is one of the rudimentary mechanics of the successful life. 'For whosoever will save his life,' the Galilean said, 'shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.' (Matthew 16:25.) What a strange paradox this! And yet one needs only to analyze it to be convinced of its truth...Only when you lift a burden, God will lift your burden. Divine paradox this! The man who staggers and falls because his burden is too great can lighten that burden by taking on the weight of another's burden. You get by giving, but your part of giving must be given first.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“Character is made by many acts; it may be lost by a single one.”  – Anonymous, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“The man of virtue makes the difficult to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent consideration; -- this may be called perfect virtue.”  – Confucius, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“Be more concerned with your character than with your reputation. Your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are.”  – Dale Carnegie, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“Let us not say, Every man is the architect of his own fortune; but let us say, Every man is the architect of his own character.”  – George Boardman, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“He who reins within himself and rules passions, desires, and fears is more than a king.”  – John Milton, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“The real character of a man is found out by his amusements.”  – Joshua Reynolds, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball
“Character is never built in a classroom; it is built in the circumstances of life.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“Character is not made in crisis -- it is only exhibited.”  – Robert Freeman, The Purpose Driven Church
“To be worth anything, character must be capable of standing firm upon its feet in the world of daily work, temptation, and trial; and able to bear the wear and tear of actual life. Cloistered virtues do not count for much.”  – Samuel Smiles, The Purpose Driven Church
“Instead of saying that man is the creature of circumstance, it would be nearer the mark to say that man is the architect of circumstance. It is character which builds an existence out of circumstance. From the same materials one man builds palaces, another hovels; one warehouses, another villas; bricks and mortar are mortar and bricks until the architect can make them something else.”  – Thomas Carlyle, The Purpose Driven Church
“Men are equal; it is not birth but virtue that makes the difference.”  – Voltaire, The Purpose Driven Church
“This above all: to thine own self be true.”  – William Shakespeare, Hamlet
“Nothing is so much calculated to lead people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand, and watch over them with tenderness. When persons manifest the least kindness and love to me, O what power it has over my mind, while the opposite course has a tendency to harrow up all the harsh feelings and depress the human mind.”  – Joseph Smith, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“The nearer we get to our Heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs. If you would have God have mercy on your, have mercy on one another.”  – Joseph Smith, History of the Church
“As disciples of Christ, we need to feel genuine charity for one another. As we do, new light will come into our own lives. This charity is essential in missionary work, but we must never allow ourselves to treat our neighbors only as potential converts. We have had the sad experience of seeing members of the Church who attempted to convert their neighbors and friends and, when they did not respond, withdrew their friendship and neighborliness. We must not be so anxious to share the gospel that we become insensitive to the feelings of others.”  – Russell M. Nelson, General Conference
“I believe it was Saint Vincent de Paul who used to say to those who wanted to join his congregation: 'Never forget, my children, that the poor are our masters. That is why we should love them and serve them, with utter respect, and do what they bid us.' Do you not believe that it can happen, on the other hand, that we treat the poor like they are a garbage bag in which we throw everything we have no use for? Food we do not like or that is going bad -- we throw it there. Perishable goods past their expiration date, and which might harm us, go into the garbage bag: in other words, go to the poor. An article of clothing that is not in style anymore, that we do not want to wear again, goes to the poor. This does not show any respect for the dignity of the poor; this is not to consider them our masters, like Saint Vincent de Paul taught his religious, but to consider them less than our equals.”  – Mother Teresa, General Conference
“One day a young couple came to our house and asked for me. They gave me a large amount of money. I asked them, 'Where did you get so much money?' They answered, 'We got married two days ago. Before we got married we had decided not to celebrate the wedding, not to buy wedding clothes, not to have a reception or a honeymoon. We wanted to give you the money we saved.' I knew what such a decision meant, especially for a Hindu family. That is why I asked them, 'But how did you think of such a thing?' 'We love each other so much,' they answered, 'that we wanted to share the joy of our love with those you serve.' To share: what a beautiful thing!”  – Mother Teresa, General Conference
“When a poor person dies of hunger, it has not happened because God did not take care of him or her. It has happened because neither you nor I wanted to give that person what he or she needed. We have refused to be instruments of love in the hands of God to give the poor a piece of bread, to offer them a dress with which to ward off the cold. It has happened because we did not recognize Christ when, once more, he appeared under the guise of pain, identified with a man numb from the cold, dying of hunger, when he came in a lonely human being, a lost child in search of a home.”  – Mother Teresa, General Conference
“There appears to be something beyond and above the reasons apparent to the human mind why chastity brings strength and power to the peoples of the earth, but it is so.”  – Joseph Fielding Smith, Gospel Doctrine
“Immorality and unchastity are so common today that our youth, seeing many types, of perversions on television and in movies, are feeling that these are accepted modes of living. I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of keeping ourselves clean and pure and chaste in order to be worthy to bear this holy priesthood and to prepare ourselves and our families f or eternal life.”  – N. Eldon Tanner, General Conference
“Faith is the power, obedience is the price, love is the motive, the Spirit is the key and Christ is the reason.”  – James E. Faust, LDS Church News
“Continue to make time in your lives and hearts for Christ.”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“If you make a great deal of Christ, He will make a great deal of you; But it you make but little of Christ, He will make but little of you.”  – R.A. Torrey, LDS Church News
“The Lord distinguishes between the Church and its members. He said He was well pleased with the restored Church, speaking collectively, but not individually (D&C 1:30). During His ministry on earth, the Lord spoke of the gospel net drawing in fish. The good fish, He said, were gathered into vessels, while the bad were cast away. (See Matthew 13:47-50). It is important to realize that while the Church is made up of mortals, no mortal is the Church. Judas, for a period of time, was a member of the Church -- in fact, one of its Apostles -- but the Church was not Judas. Sometimes we hear someone refer to a division in the Church. In reality, the Church is not divided. It simply means that there are some who, for the time being at least, are members of the Church but not in harmony with it. These people have a temporary membership and influence in the Church; but unless they repent, they will be missing when the final membership records are recorded.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, God
“I have never known a person, man or woman, who attended his meetings, and partook of the spirit and inspiration that are present in the meetings of true, faithful Latter-day Saints, who has ever apostasized.”  – Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards
“Worship is an individual activity, even at church. If one wishes to worship the Lord, they may do so by song, prayer, and participation in the sacrament. If the service is a failure, it is you who have failed. No one can worship for you.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Missionaries should sit with investigators or new members and not sit as a group of missionaries.”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“Church attendance is as vital to a disciple, as a transfusion of rich healthy blood to a sick man.”  – D.L. Moody, LDS Church News
“Don't focus on growing a church with programs, focus on growing people with a process.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“Most churches rarely attract unbelievers to their services because members are uncomfortable bringing them to church. It doesn't matter how much the pastor encourages members to bring friends or how many visitation programs are launched, the results are the same: Most members never bring any lost friends to church. Why is this? There are three important reasons. First, as I mentioned, the target of the messages is unpredictable. Members don't know from week to week if the pastor will be preaching an evangelistic message or an edification message. Second, the services are not designed for unbelievers; so much of what goes on in them would not be understandable to an unchurched friend. Third, members may be embarrassed by the quality of the service.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“The church should be seeker sensitive but it must not be seeker driven. We must adapt our communication style to our culture without adopting the sinful elements of it or abdicating to it.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“To accommodate our continuous growth we used seventy-nine different facilities in the first fifteen years of Saddleback's history...I'm often asked, 'How big can a church grow without a building?' The answer is, 'I don't know!' Saddleback met for fifteen years and grew to 10,000 attenders without our own building, so I know it's possible to grow to at least 10,000! A building, or lack of a building, should never be allowed to become a barrier to a wave of growth. People are far more important than property.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“What is the most natural way to increase the number of visitors to your church? By making members feel guilty for not inviting friends? No. By putting up a big sign that says 'Visitors Welcome'? No. By cold-calling on homes in your community? Probably not. By holding advertising contests? Unlikely. By using telemarking or advertising? Wrong again. The answer is quite simple: Create a service that is intentionally designed for your members to bring their friends to. And make the service so attractive, relevant, an appealing to the unchurched that your members are eager to share it with the lost people they care about.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“The difference between those who are committed and those who are not is the difference between the words want and will.”  – Marvin J. Ashton, Ensign
“A civilization is built on what is required of men, not on that which is provided for them.”  – Antoine de St. Exupery, Ensign
“Neutral men are the devil's allies”  – Edwin Hubbel Chapin, Ensign
“[Missionary companions] stand as witnesses one with another. What a precious thing is a good companion. He becomes your protector in times of trouble or temptation.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“[The companion] is there for a purpose. He isn't there just to decorate you. He's there to make you shine, he's there to serve a great purpose. Think of what life would be without your companion. Getting up every morning alone, going out to work, knocking on doors every day, alone. Pretty scary, wouldn't it be? I think it would. Be grateful for your companions. I thank the Lord and will always be grateful for my companions in the mission field.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, New Mission President Seminar
“Treasure your companions. They have something to offer you if you will learn. Look for the good in them, and help them. Help one another. Get on your knees and pray to the Lord and ask Him to bless you. Never leave your apartments in the morning without asking for the directing and protecting guidance of the Lord. And never come back to them in the evening and go to bed without getting on your knees and thanking Him for the blessings of the day.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Hamilton
“Friendship renders prosperity more brilliant, while it lightens adversity by sharing it and making its burdens common.”  – Marcus Tullius Cicero, Hamilton
“If I am walking with two other men, each of them will serve as my teacher. I will pick out the good points of the one and imitate them, and the bad points of the other and correct them in myself.”  – Confucius, Hamilton
“The most agreeable of all companions is a simple, frank man, without any high pretensions to an oppressive greatness; one who loves life, and understands the use of it; obliging, alike, at all hours; above all, of a golden temper, and steadfast as an anchor. For such a one we gladly exchange the greatest genius, the most brilliant wit, the profoundest thinker.”  – Gotthold Lessing, Hamilton
“You can employ men and hire hands to work for you, but you must win their hearts to have them work with you.”  – Tiorio, Hamilton
“All men who have moved the world have been men who would stand true to their conscience.”  – David O. McKay, General Conference
“You cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible!”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Ensign
“I would sooner have the approval of my own conscience and know that I had done my duty than to have the praise of all of the world and not have the approval of my own conscience. A man's conscience, when he is living as he should, is the finest monitor and the best judge in all the world.”  – Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards
“The only way to cure a bad conscience is to stop doing what we shouldn't, and start doing what we should.”  – Richard L. Evans, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
