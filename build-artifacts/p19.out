“Sincere prayer implies that when we ask for any virtue or blessing, we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue.”  – David O. McKay, Pathways to Happiness
“If you want the blessing, don't just kneel down and pray about it. Prepare yourselves in every conceivable way you can in order to make yourselves worthy to receive the blessing you seek. Brigham Young illustrated this when he said: 'You may go to some people here, and ask what ails them, and they answer, 'I don't know but we feel a dreadful distress in the stomach and in the back; we feel all out of order, and we wish you to lay hands on us.' He said to these people, 'Have you used any remedies?' meaning herbs or whatever the pioneers had. 'No,' they said, 'we wish the Elders to lay hands upon us, and we have faith that we shall be healed.' President Young said: 'That is very inconsistent according to my faith. If we are sick, and ask the Lord to heal us, and to do all for us that is necessary to be done, according to my understanding of the Gospel of salvation, I might as well ask the Lord to cause my wheat and corn to grow without my plowing the ground and casting in the seed. It appears consistent to me to apply every remedy that comes within the range of my knowledge, and then ask my Father in heaven, in the name of Jesus Christ, to sanctify that application to the healing of my body...But supposing we were traveling in the mountains, and all we had or could get, in the shape of nourishment, was a little venison, and one or two were taken sick, without anything in the world in the shape of healing medicine within our reach, what should we do? According to my faith, ask the Lord Almighty to send an angel to heal the sick. This is our privilege...' (Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 163) When we are situated that we cannot get anything to help ourselves, then we may call upon the Lord and His servants who can do all. But it is our duty to do what we can within our own power.”  – Harold B. Lee, Stand Ye in Holy Places
“A few years ago, Bishop Stanley Smoot was interviewed by President Spencer W. Kimball. President Kimball asked, 'How often do you have family prayer?' Bishop Smoot answered, 'We try to have family prayer twice a day, but we average about once.' President Kimball answered, 'In the past, having family prayer once a day may have been all right. But in the future it will not be enough if we are going to save our families.'”  – James E. Faust, General Conference
“I have reason to believe that many of the Latter-day Saints, during a great portion of their lives, could approach the Lord in all confidence and make this same prayer-- 'Search me, O God, and know my heart, and see if there be any wicked way in me (Psalm 139:23-24);' but if we, as a people could live so as to be able at all times to bow before the Lord and offer up a prayer like this, what a delightful thing it would be, what an attainment we should have acquired in righteousness and good works! To every person who has at heart the preparing of himself for the great change, that is the work of regeneration, I would recommend that he adopt this prayer of David, and see how near he can live according to the light that he has, so as to make it in all sincerity part of his devotions to God. Many fail in coming up to this standard of excellence because they do things in secret where mortal eye cannot penetrate, that has a direct tendency to alienate them from the Almighty, and to grieve away the Spirit of God. Such persons cannot in their private closet use this prayer; they could not unless they had repented of their sins and repaired the wrong they may have committed, and determined to do better in the future than they had done in the past, and to establish a character before God that could be relied upon in the hour of trial, and that would fit them to associate with holy beings and with the Father himself when they shall have passed into the spirit world.”  – Lorenzo Snow, Journal of Discourses

“Let everyone try and find that as a result of daily prayer he adds something new to his life, something with which nothing can be compared.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. . . . It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Prayer is not asking. Prayer is putting oneself in the hands of God, at his disposition, and listening to his voice in the depths of our hearts.”  – Mother Teresa, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“In missionary work, as in all else, preparation precedes power. Encouragement to prepare while still very young can make a tremendous difference.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Regional Representatives Seminar
“The best preparation for good work tomorrow is good work today.”  – Elbert Hubbard, Regional Representatives Seminar
“Success is the sum of detail.”  – Harvey S. Firestone, Regional Representatives Seminar
“You cannot speak that which you do not know. You cannot share that which you do not feel. You cannot translate that which you do not have. And you cannot give that which you do not possess. To give it and to share it, and for it to be effective, you first need to have it. Good communication starts with good preparation.”  – Jim Rohn, Regional Representatives Seminar
“Victory is achieved before, not during, battle.”  – Sun Tzu, Regional Representatives Seminar
“At what age do we begin teaching our sons these gospel truths? Alma taught his son Helaman while he was in his youth (see Alma 36:3). Our youth ought not to wait until the mission field to get a grasp of the scriptures and a closeness to the Lord. Lehi said that his son Jacob beheld the glory of the Lord in his youth (see 2 Nephi 2:4). Imagine what would happen to missionary work if we sent out that kind of young men.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“Give me a young man who has kept himself morally clean and has faithfully attended his church meetings. Give me a young man who has magnified his priesthood and has earned the Duty of God Award and is an Eagle Scout. Give me a young man who is a Seminary graduate and has a burning testimony of the Book of Mormon. Give me such a young man, and I will give you a young man who can perform miracles for the Lord in the mission field and throughout his life.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“If you want to get the spirit of the gospel in your home, support the missionary program. Prepare your sons and daughters through your home evenings; through setting the proper example in your homes. Prepare to send them into the mission field. These young sons and daughters will bless your names forever if you help to make it possible through your training and your example and your willingness to sacrifice just a little, if you can call it sacrifice, to see them go into the mission field.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Glasgow Scotland Area Conference
“Prepare yourselves mentally. A mission requires a great deal of mental preparation. You must memorize missionary discussions, memorize scriptures, and oftentimes learn a new language. The discipline to do this is learned in your early years. Establish now the daily practice of reading the scriptures ten to fifteen minutes each day. If you do so, by the time you reach the mission field, you will have read all four of the standard works. I urge you to read particularly the Book of Mormon so that you can testify of its truthfulness as the Lord has directed.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“Reading the Book of Mormon is one of the greatest persuaders to get men on missions. We need more missionaries. But we also need better-prepared missionaries coming out of the wards and branches and homes where they know and love the Book of Mormon. A great challenge and day of preparation is at hand for missionaries to meet and teach with the Book of Mormon. We need missionaries to match our message.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Regional Representatives Seminar
“We all have confidence that when we have fully prepared ourselves, the Lord will provide a way for us to take the gospel to those lands now closed to our missionaries. President Spencer W. Kimball has said, 'Somehow, brethren, I feel that when we have done all in our power that the Lord will find a way to open doors. That is my faith.' We all share this faith.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Mission Presidents' Seminar
“We love all of our missionaries who are serving the Lord full-time in the mission field. But there is a difference in missionaries. Some are better prepared to serve the Lord the first month in the mission than some who are returning home after twenty-four months. We want young men entering the mission field who can enter the mission field 'on the run,' who have faith, born of personal righteousness and clean living, that they can have a great and productive mission.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“We want to send forth missionaries who have a testimony of the scriptures and who are spiritually prepared to be guided and instructed of the Spirit, that they in turn may teach by that same spirit. Is that too much to ask? Not if we commence early enough and prepare well enough.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Regional Representatives' Seminar
“It follows that if we have more missionaries, there will be more converts. It also follow that if missionaries are better prepared, they will be more effective.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign
“It is deemed inconsistent to send men out into the world to promise to others through obedience to the gospel that which they have not themselves received. Neither is it considered proper to send men out to reform them.”  – Joseph Fielding Smith, Gospel Doctrine
“Awake to righteousness, and sin not; let your light shine, and show yourselves workmen that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. Apply yourselves diligently to study, that your minds may be stored with all necessary information.”  – Joseph Smith, Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“Missionary preparation consists largely of effort in three areas: 1. Keeping one's life clean and worthy and remaining free from all sins of the world. The Lord has provided that forgiveness can be had if there is total repentance. If there have been problems, there must be a total transformation of one's life, if he is to be forgiven. 2. Preparing one's mind and the spirit to know the truth. To arrive at mission age and be illiterate in the gospel or the common knowledge of the world would be most unfortunate indeed. Certainly by the time young people reach the age when they are eligible to be called, they should be prepared to step from conventional roles at home into the important role of the missionary without a total reorganization of their life, standards, or training. 3. Preparing to finance the mission so it may be the missionary's own contribution, as far as is possible. It costs money to go to the various parts of the world and preach the gospel. How wonderful it would be if each future missionary were to have saved for a mission from birth. How wonderful it would be if each missionary were to totally or largely finance his or her own mission and thereby receive most of the blessings coming from missionary labors.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, President Kimball Speaks Out
