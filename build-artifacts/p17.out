I am happy to say, not boastfully but gratefully, that I have never hesitated to follow the counsel of the Authorities of the Church even though it crossed my social, professional or political life.”  – Marion G. Romney, CR

This is our work. We have a long eternity before us.”  – Wilford Woodruff, General Conference
