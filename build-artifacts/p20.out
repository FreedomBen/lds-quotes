“Preparing one's mind and the spirit to know the truth. To arrive at mission age and be illiterate in the gospel or the common knowledge of the world would be most unfortunate indeed. Certainly by the time young people reach the age when they are eligible to be called, they should be prepared to step from conventional roles at home into the important role of the missionary without a total reorganization of their life, standards, or training.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, President Kimball Speaks Out
“I will prepare and someday my chance will come.”  – Abraham Lincoln, President Kimball Speaks Out

“Chance favors the prepared mind.”  – Louis Pasteur, President Kimball Speaks Out
“Doubt with regard to what we ought to know is a condition too violent for the human mind, it cannot long be endured; in spite of itself the mind decides one way or another, and it prefers to be deceived rather than to believe nothing. I suppose this prodigious diversity of opinion is caused, in the first place, by the weakness of the human intellect; and, in the second, by pride.”  – Jean-Jacques Rousseau, President Kimball Speaks Out
“Some of us are inclined to look to the weaknesses and shortcomings of others in order to expand our own comfort zone.”  – Marvin J. Ashton, Ensign
“Expedients are for the hour; principles for the ages.”  – Henry Ward Beecher, Ensign
“Our principles are the springs of our actions; our actions the springs of our happiness or misery. Too much care, therefore, cannot be taken in forming our principles.”  – Philip Skelton, Ensign
“The value of a principle is the number of things it will explain, and there is no good theory of disease which does not at once suggest a cure.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ensign
“Never let things which matter most be at the mercy of things which matter least.”  – Marion D. Hanks, Ensign
“Life is so great in its opportunities and possibilities, that you should rise confidently above the inevitable trifles incident to daily contact with the world. Life is too precious to be sacrificed for the nonessential and transient... Ignore the inconsequential.”  – Grenville Kleiser, Ensign
“We have so much to look after, so many business interests, so many important things, so far as dollars and cents are concerned, that we are neglecting the one great thing of all; namely; the proclaiming of the gospel, and making [instead] what some people call sacrifices but what actually are the exact opposite. We have in very deed the pearl of great price.”  – Heber J. Grant, CR
“When priorities are in place, one can more patiently tolerate unfinished business.”  – Russell M. Nelson, Ensign
“I conceive that the great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by false estimates they have made of the value of things.”  – Benjamin Franklin, Ensign
“Action expresses priorities.”  – Charles Garfield, Ensign
“There are men in this Church who are as good in their hearts and feelings as men ever were, but lack faith and energy, and do not obtain really what it is their privilege to receive. If their faith, their energy and determination were equal to their good feelings and desires, their honesty and goodness, they would indeed be mighty men in Israel; and sickness and disease and the power of the evil one would flee before them as chaff before the wind.”  – Lorenzo Snow, Journal of Discourses

“Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Journal of Discourses
“God wants your church to be both faithful and fruitful. One without the other is only half the equation. Numerical results are no justification for being unfaithful to the message, but neither can we use faithfulness as an excuse for being ineffective! Churches that have few or no conversions often attempt to justify their ineffectiveness with the statement, 'God has not called us to be successful. He has just called us to be faithful.' I strongly disagree because the Bible clearly teaches that God expects both.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“The Bible also compares ministry to farming, another profession that requires skill. A farmer can be a dedicated and hard worker but he must also be skilled in using the right equipment. If he tries to harvest a corn field with a wheat harvester, he's bound to fail. If he tries to harvest tomatoes with a cotton picker, he'll end up with a mess! Successful ministry, like farming, requires more than dedication and hard work; it takes skill, timing, and the right tools.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“Personally, I hold that a man, who deliberately and intelligently takes a pledge and then breaks it, forfeits his manhood.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, The Purpose Driven Church
“Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms.”  – Thomas Fuller, The Purpose Driven Church
“We gather the poorest of the people, the unlearned, and a few of the learned; but generally, we gather the poor, who wish to be redeemed; who feel the oppression the high and the proud have made them endure; they have felt a wish to be delivered, and consequently their ears were open to receive the truth. Take those who are in the enjoyment of all the luxuries of life, and their ears are stopped up; they cannot hear.”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“War destroys men, but luxury destroys mankind; at once corrupts the body and the mind.”  – John Crowne, Discourses of Brigham Young

“The wisdom of the wise and the experience of the ages are perpetuated by quotations.”  – Benjamin Disraeli, Discourses of Brigham Young
“The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgement should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge.”  – Albert Einstein, Discourses of Brigham Young
“On one point--on that I was quite clear--my ideas differed from (Pastor Wennagel's, his confirmation teacher) in spite of all the respect I showed him. He wanted to make us understand that in submission to faith all reasoning must be silenced. But I was convinced--and I am so still--that the fundamental principles of Christianity have to be proved true by reasoning, and by no other method. Reason, I said to myself, is given us that we may bring everything within the range of its action, even the most exalted ideas of religion. And this certainty filled me with joy.”  – Albert Schweitzer, Discourses of Brigham Young
“A habit of basing convictions upon evidence, and of giving to them only that degree of certainty which the evidence warrants, would, if it became general, cure most of the ills from which the world suffers.”  – Bertrand Russell, Discourses of Brigham Young
“Faith...Must be enforced by reason...When faith becomes blind it dies.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, Discourses of Brigham Young

“You can't live principles you can't understand.”  – Stephen R. Covey, Ensign
“I think there is only one quality worse than hardness of the heart, and that is softness of the head.”  – Theodore Roosevelt, Ensign
“He that will not reason is a bigot; he that cannot reason is a fool; and he that dares not reason is a slave.”  – William Drummond, Ensign
“Men are apt to mistake the strength of their feelings for the strength of their argument. The heated mind resents the chill touch and relentless scrutiny of logic.”  – William E. Gladstone, Ensign
“The proper method for hastening the decay of error is...by teaching every man to think for himself.”  – William Godwin, Ensign
“True genius resides in the capacity for evaluation of uncertain, hazardous and conflicting information.”  – Winston Churchill, Ensign
“If we are afraid to rebuke iniquity, or ashamed to cast it off ourselves, Israel would go to hell, and should be cut off as a people, and the Lord would raise up another, for he is bound to have a people in the last days who will keep His commandments, and magnify their calling, and prove themselves friends of God, and maintain the principles of righteousness and honor them before God, angels, and men, that his kingdom may be established in purity, and be prepared for the coming of the Messiah: for Christ is coming again to earth; he is preparing the bride, and here is a portion of it before me today. Will He receive us to himself? Are we prepared for His coming and kingdom and fullness thereof, unless we are sanctified, and lay aside sin, and do right? No. We must sanctify ourselves, and keep the commandments of God, and do these things that are required of our hands, before we can be prepared for the coming of the Great Bridegroom.”  – Wilford Woodruff, The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff
