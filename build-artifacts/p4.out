“We are in a great school, and we should be diligent to learn, and continue to store up the knowledge of heaven and of earth, and read good books, although I cannot say that I would recommend the reading of all books, for it is not all books which are good. Read good books, and extract from them wisdom and understanding as much as you possibly can, aided by the Spirit of God.”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“Learning is not attained by chance. It must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence.”  – Abigail Adams, CR
“Some people throw away a bushel of truth because it contains a grain of error, while others swallow a bushel of error because it contains a grain of truth.”  – Anonymous, CR
“You see, in life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know. Knowing is not enough! You must take action.”  – Anthony Robbins, CR
“Some people claim that it is okay to read trashy novels because sometimes you can find something valuable in them. You can also find a crust of bread in a garbage can, if you search long enough, but there is a better way.”  – Jim Rohn, CR
“All wish to possess knowledge, but few, comparatively speaking, are willing to pay the price.”  – Juvenal, CR

“A man prayed, and at first he thought that prayer was talking. But he became more and more quiet until in the end he realized that prayer is listening.”  – Soren Kierkegaard, Ensign
“Say your prayers always before going to work. Never forget that. A father-the head of the family-should never miss calling his family together and dedicating himself and them to the Lord of Hosts, asking the guidance and direction of his Holy Spirit to lead them through the day-that very day. Lead us this day, guide us this day, preserve us this day, save us from sinning against thee or any being in heaven or on earth this day! If we do this every day, the last day we live we will be prepared to enjoy a higher glory.”  – Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses
“Prayer is the yearning of the spirit. Sincere praying implies that when we ask for any virtue or blessing we should work for the blessing and cultivate the virtue...Why pray for the Kingdom of God to come unless you have in your heart a desire and a willingness to aid in its establishment? Praying for His will to be done and then not trying to live it, gives you a negative answer at once. You would not grant something to a child who showed that attitude towards a request he is making of you. If we pray for the success of some cause or enterprise, manifestly we are in sympathy with it. It is the height of disloyalty to pray for God's will to be done, and then fail to conform our lives to that will.”  – David O. McKay, Pathways to Happiness
“Petitioning in prayer has taught me, again and again, that the vault of heaven with all its blessings is to be opened only by a combination lock. One tumbler falls when there is faith, a second when there is personal righteousness; the third and final tumbler falls only when what is sought is, in God's judgment -- not ours -- right for us. Sometimes we pound on the vault door for something we want very much and wonder why the door does not open. We would be very spoiled children if that vault door opened any more easily than it does. I can tell, looking back, that God truly loves me by inventorying the petitions He has refused to grant me. Our rejected petitions tell us much about ourselves but also much about our flawless Father.”  – Neal A. Maxwell, Deposition of a Disciple
“Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks.”  – Thomas S. Monson, Deposition of a Disciple

“There are two kinds of people: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, 'All right, then, have it your way.'”  – C. S. Lewis, Lincoln Observed The Civil War Dispatches of Noah Brooks
“Prayer is not a substitute for work; it is a sometimes desparate effort to work further and to be efficient beyond the range of one's powers. It is not the lazy who are most inclined to prayer; those pray most who care most, and who, having worked hard, find it intolerable to be defeated.”  – George Santayana, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Prayer is a conversation with God, but prayer is no substitute for work.”  – Henry D. Moyle, The Missionary's Little Quote Book

“Prayer does not change God, but changes him who prays.”  – Soren Kierkegaard, The Missionary's Little Quote Book

“Teenagers also sometimes think, 'What's the use? The world will soon be blown all apart and come to an end.' That feeling comes from fear, not from faith. No one knows the hour or the day (see D&C 49:7), but the end cannot come until all of the purposes of the Lord are fulfilled. Everything that I have learned from the revelations and from life convinces me that there is time and to spare for you to carefully prepare for a long life.”  – Boyd K. Packer, General Conference
“Success is bearing as much fruit as possible given your gifts, opportunities, and potential.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church

“Sweat plus sacrifice equals success.”  – Charles O. Finley, Conference Report
“Why have these great missionaries and others like them been willing to sacrifice the comforts of home, family, loved ones and sweethearts to answer the call to serve? It's because they have a testimony of Jesus Christ. And when they know Him there is no bed too hard or too short. No sacrifice is too great to serve the Master who sacrificed His all to provide the way for His brothers and sisters to return home to their Heavenly Father. And because they are faithful to their callings, thousands will revere their names throughout eternity.”  – Harold G. Hillam, LDS Church News
“Possessions, outward success, publicity, luxury -- to me these have always been contemptible. I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best for both the body and the mind.”  – Albert Einstein, General Conference
“You can't have everything. Where would you put it?”  – Steven Wright, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
