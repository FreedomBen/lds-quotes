“An inventor is simply a person who doesn't take his education too seriously. You see, from the time a person is six years old until he graduates from college he has to take three or four examinations a year. If he flunks once, he is out. But an inventor is almost always failing. He tries and fails maybe a thousand times. If he succeeds once then he's in. These two things are diametrically opposite. We often say that the biggest job we have is to teach a newly hired employee how to fail intelligently. We have to train him to experiment over and over and to keep trying and failing until he learns what will work.”  – Charles Kettering, LDS Church News

“We also wish [missionaries] to understand the geography, habits, customs, and laws of nations and kingdoms...This is recommended in the revelations given to us [see D&C 88:78-80. 93:53].

We must have some knowledge of the religious and philosophical thoughts. (2) We must be conversant with the foreign life of its individual, social, and political aspects. (3) One should study and know their best literature. (4) Before you can understand a people you must know how they think. (5) Be respectful to other peoples' beliefs, and forms of worship, as you expect them to be tolerant with you and your teachings.”  – David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life
“Looking at the world as a collection of individual nations is not the best approach because it assumes that all people in a nation are the same. Yugoslavia is a classic example.

Yet the people of any given age and country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject on which mankind had always been agreed. The rules which obtain among themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying.”  – John Stuart Mill, On Liberty
“Targeting for evangelism begins with finding out all you can about your community.
