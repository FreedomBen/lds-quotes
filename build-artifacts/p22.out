“Our message is so imperative, when you stop to think that the salvation, the eternal salvation of the world, rests upon the shoulders of this Church. When all is said and done, if the world is going to be saved, we have to do it. There is no escaping from that. No other people in the history of the world have received the kind of mandate that we have received. We are responsible for all who have lived upon the earth. That involves our family history and temple work. We are responsible for all who now live upon the earth, and that involves our missionary work. And we are going to be responsible for all who will yet live upon the earth. No one ever received a greater or more compelling mandate than we of this Church have received, and we'd better be getting at it. I see that it did so much for me, far greater than the time spent, two years. The things that happened in my life transcend so many other values. I am here today because of that mission, and I plead with you now to make the most of your missions.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, New Mission Presidents' Seminar
“The world is our responsibility. We cannot evade it.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign
“We have never found, and I think we never shall find, an adequate substitute for the situation in which two wholesome young men meet with a family, reason with them, teach them, testify to them, and pray with them. We shall always need missionaries.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference
“We have so much to do in this world to spread the influence of this gospel. Let us go forth on our assigned mission. We feel the compulsion of the Lord's mandate to teach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. We hope that in so doing we shall not offend, but rather that we shall do so with graciousness and in the spirit of love which was the very essence of him of whom we testify.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference
“It annoys me when men whom the Lord blesses with great abundance are not willing to do their full duty.”  – Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards
“One great trouble is that we ofttimes lose sight of what is the most valuable labor for us to perform, the labor that will be most pleasing in the sight of our Heavenly Father.”  – Heber J. Grant, CR
“The first and great commandment was to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, might, mind, and strength; and the second was like unto it, to love our neighbors as ourselves. And the best way in the world to show our love for our neighbors is to go forth and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, of which He has given us an absolute knowledge concerning its divinity.”  – Heber J. Grant, CR
“If you do not magnify your calling, God will hold you responsible for those you might have saved, had you done your duty.”  – John Taylor, CR
“It is our duty to concentrate all our influence to make popular that which is sound and good, and unpopular that which is unsound.”  – Joseph Smith, History of the Church
“Our missionaries are going forth in different nations...the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may raise, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth nobly, boldly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.”  – Joseph Smith, Wentworth Letter
“All young men in the Church should be very eager to go on a mission, and they should also help their parents to fill missions after the families are raised. Young people should study the gospel, prepare themselves for service in the Church, and keep the commandments as diligently as it is possible to do. Young people who have planned to fill missions are more fruitful, more effective, and more successful when they serve, and more people will come into the Church and will create more enthusiasm, and there will be a chain reaction. Is there any other thing than the gospel that would have a greater chain reaction and affect more interests and people?”  – Spencer W. Kimball, President Kimball Speaks Out
“Perhaps the greatest reason for missionary work is to give the world it's chance to hear and accept the gospel. The scriptures are replete with commands and promises and calls and rewards for teach the gospel. I use the word command deliberately for it seems to be an insistent directive from which we, singly and collectively, cannot escape...I wonder if we are doing all we can. Are we complacent in our approach to teaching all the world? We have been proselyting now 144 years. Are we prepared to lengthen our stride? To enlarge our vision?”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Ensign
“When I ask for more missionaries, I am not asking for more testimony-barren or unworthy missionaries, I am asking that we start earlier and train our missionaries better in every branch and ward in the world. That is another challenge -- that the young people will understand that it is a great privilege to go on a mission and that they must be physically well, mentally well, spiritually well, and that the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance. I am asking for missionaries who have been carefully indoctrinated and trained through the family and the organizations of the Church, and who come to the mission with a great desire. I am asking for better interviews, more searching interviews, more sympathetic and understanding interviews, but especially that we train prospective missionaries much better, much earlier, much longer, so that each anticipates his mission with great joy.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Ensign
“The work is demanding, the impact everlasting. This is no time for 'summer soldiers' in the army of the Lord.”  – Thomas S. Monson, Ensign
“I have now disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion.”  – Patrick Henry, Ensign
“Men do less than they ought, unless they do all that they can.”  – Thomas Carlyle, Ensign
“It isn't enough to do one's best. One must do what is necessary.”  – Winston Churchill, Ensign
“If you want to know your past, look into your present conditions. If you want to know your future, look into your present actions.”  – Buddhist proverb, Ensign
“Luck is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity.”  – Floyd Maxwell, Ensign
“Results are the best measurement of human progress. Not conversation. Not explanation. Not justification. Results! And if our results are less than our potential suggests that they should be, then we must strive to become more today than we were the day before. The greatest rewards are always reserved for those who bring great value to themselves and the world around them as a result of who and what they have become.”  – Jim Rohn, Ensign
“No matter how you build it, The ship must sail. You can't explain it to the sea.”  – Unknown, Ensign
“Here is a great key to reactivation of many of those who have fallen by the wayside. Each has a talent that can be employed. It is the task of leaders to match those talents with needs, and then to offer a challenge.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign
“With the ever-increasing number of converts, we must make an increasingly substantial effort to assist them as they find their way. Every one of them needs three things: a friend, a responsibility, and nurturing with the 'good word of God' (Moroni 6:4). It is our duty and opportunity to provide these things.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference
“Converts are much easier kept than recovered.”  – David Stewart, General Conference
“A convert is a 'precious person. He or she will make a tremendous decision in coming into the Church. Retention will primarily be the work of the local wards and branches. However, you have a very, very important part in this. Your missionaries must be sure that conversion is real, that it is life-changing, that it is something that is to last forever and go on through generations...There is no point in baptizing people if they do not become solid members of the Church.' Actual harm, he said, may be done to those who leave old friendships and old ways of doing things only to be allowed to slip into inactivity.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“He said missionaries should keep in touch with those who have been baptized. 'Any individual who has been worthy of baptism is worthy of saving, now and for as long as he lives and the generations who follow.'”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“I believe it is totally unnecessary that we lose [any of] those who are baptized.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“It is an absolute imperative that we look after those who have become a part of us.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference
“Nobody gains when there is baptism without retention, The missionary loses, and while the Church gains statistically, the membership suffers, really, and the enthusiasm of the convert turns to ashes.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“They [the missionaries] still have an obligation to nurture and help those they have baptized - to befriend them, to write to them, to give them encouragement. But greater than that is your responsibility, my brethren, as bishops, as stake presidents, as elders quorum presidents, to put your arms around these people and make them feel comfortable and at home and warm and happy. It is an imperative. What does it profit the missionary to baptize someone who leaves the Church within six months? Nothing is accomplished, in fact, damage is done. We have pulled them away from their old moorings and brought them into the Church, only to have them drift away.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Woods Cross Utah Regional Conference
“Those who have come into the Church made a great sacrifice, many of them, when they were baptized. They are precious. They are the same kind of people that you are and their generations will become the same kind of people as will your generations if they are nurtured and brought along in the Church. I don't know how to say it more strongly. This is a matter about which I feel so deeply as I go about this Church across the world.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Woods Cross Utah Regional Conference
“Will you please see that every convert who comes into the Church while you are here on this mission is so taught that he or she will grow in faith and that a year after baptism he or she will be ready to get a temple recommend, and as soon as the temple is completed will be eligible to go to the house of the Lord?”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Bolivia Cochabamba Missionary Meeting
“President Hinckley's strong, continuing challenge to us is retention, which requires full cooperation between the missionary, the leaders and members.”  – James E. Faust, Church News
“Elder Perry noted that, according to research, 86 percent of the active converts have close personal ties to other LDS members or relatives.”  – L. Tom Perry, LDS Church News
“The role of missionaries has expanded in recent years to include convert retention and activation. . . . The salvation of souls is not compartmentalized. One soul is as precious as another. We are as interested in less-active members as we are a non-member.”  – Richard G. Scott, LDS Church News
“Much of the sorrow and distress that is afflicting and will continue to afflict mankind is traceable to the fact that they have ignored[God's] admonition to keep the Sabbath day holy.”  – George Albert Smith, CR
“If we were looking for some program to cure all of the problems that presently beset our world, we might well find it by properly observing the Sabbath day. The importance of the Sabbath is prefigured in the account of creation. In programming the seven creative periods, God set aside the seventh day as his Sabbath. And then in our interests he especially blessed and hallowed this one day out of each week, which he ordained to be our Sabbath day. And what a magnificent day it is when it is used as he intended.”  – Sterling W. Sill, Conference Report
“Sunday is the core of our civilization, dedicated to thought and reverence.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Conference Report
“Some men are willing to die for their faith, but they are not willing to fully live for it.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Conference Report
“The lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters thehouse a guest and then becomes a host, and then a master.”  – Kahlil Gibran, Conference Report
“Yielding ourselves to the Lord always requires sacrifice, and often a sacrifice of our sins. How many favorite sins are we holding onto that alienate us from the Spirit and keep us from turning our lives over to the Lord? Things such as jealousy, or holding onto grudge, or being casual about the Sabbath day, or the wearing of the garment, or what we watch or read? Imagine the rippling impact on our lives and our families if every one of us determined at this moment to sacrifice something that is dulling our spiritual senses.”  – Sheri Dew, BYU Womens Conference
“The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, and love of soft living and the get-rich-quick theory of life.”  – Theodore Roosevelt, BYU Womens Conference
“If you give anything for the building up of the Kingdom of God, give the best you have.”  – Brigham Young, Discourse of Brigham Young
“Now, you Elders who understand the principles of the kingdom of God, what would you not give, do, or sacrifice, to assist in building up His kingdom upon the earth? Says one, 'I would do anything in my power, anything that the Lord would help me to do, to build up His kingdom.' Says another, 'I would sacrifice all my property.' Wonderful indeed! Do you not know that the possession of your property is like a shadow, or the dew of the morning before the noon-day sun, that you cannot have any assurance of its control for a single moment! It is the unseen hand of Providence that controls it. In short, what would you sacrifice? The Saints sacrifice everything; but, strictly speaking, there is no sacrifice about it. If you give a penny for a million of gold! A handful of earth for a planet! A temporary worn out tenement for one glorified, that will exist, abide, and continue to increase throughout a never ending eternity, what a sacrifice to be sure!”  – Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses
“We talk about our trials and troubles here in this life: but suppose that you could see yourselves thousands and millions of years after you have proved faithful to your religion during the few short years in this time, and have obtained eternal salvation and a crown of glory in the presence of God; then look back upon your lives here, and see the losses, crosses, and disappointments, the sorrows ... you would be constrained to exclaim, 'But what of all that? Those things were but for a moment, and we are now here. We have been faithful during a few moments in our mortality, and now we enjoy eternal life and glory, with power to progress in all the boundless knowledge and through the countless stages of progression, enjoying the smiles and approbation of our Father and God, and of Jesus Christ our elder brother.'”  – Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses
“Willingly we give of our time and our means with which He may bless us to the establishment of His kingdom in the earth. This we know is our first duty and our great opportunity... In a statement published to the world during the last world war, the First Presidency of the Church declared: 'No act of ours or of the Church must interfere with this God-given mandate.'”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“The cross to be taken up may be heavy, perhaps to be dragged because too burdensome to be borne. We are apt to assume that self-denial is the sole material of our cross; but this is true only as we regard self-denial in its broadest sense, comprising both positive and negative aspects. One man's cross may consist mostly in refraining from doings to which he is inclined, another's in doing what he would fain escape. One's besetting sin is evil indulgence; his neighbor's a lazy inattention to the activities required by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, coupled perchance with puritanical rigor in other observances. But the great question, striking home to every thoughtful soul, is that of the Master -- 'For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?' (Matt. 16:26). It is possible then for a man to lose his own soul. To deny is to reject the Lord's own doctrine. The safeguard against such incalculable loss is specifically indicated -- to follow the Savior; and this can mean only keeping His commandments, whatever the temporary suffering or worldly sacrifice may be.”  – James E. Talmage, The Vitality of Mormonism
“The Savior gave of Himself, gave His very life that we might live. To sacrifice that others might be blessed was His word, His work, His life. Sacrifice is the evidence of true love. Without sacrifice love is not manifest. Without sacrifice there is no real love, or kindness... We love no one unless we sacrifice for him. We can measure the degree of love that we possess for any man or cause, by the sacrifice we make for him or it.”  – John A. Widtsoe, General Conference
“It is preoccupation with possession, more than anything else, that prevents men from living freely and nobly.”  – Bertrand Russell, General Conference
“The important thing is this: to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.”  – Charles du Bos, General Conference
