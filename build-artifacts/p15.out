“Let us be serene and filled with peace and love as we live in a world that is unfortunately filled with increasing crime and violence.

You are commanded to search after wisdom from the best of books, and also through faith; and I will promise you that diligent study of our own works will place you in possession of a fund of knowledge that you never dreamed of. And then devote your leisure time to the acquisition of such useful knowledge as can be obtained through the schools, and from works on the sciences; but do not be led by their nonsense and skepticism, and false theories. And in doing this, seek earnestly for the Spirit of God to aid you, to enlighten your mind, that you may the better comprehend truth, and be able to discard error.”  – John Taylor, Journal of Discourses

It isn't learning or the love of learning, or knowledge, or the pursuit of any subject that would take from a man his faith, but it is failure to keep the commandments, the failure of a man to feed all sides of himself...”  – Richard L. Evans, CR

“We should be a people of profound learning pertaining to the things of the world. We should be familiar with the various languages, for we wish to send missionaries to the different nations and to the islands of the sea.

Both roles are important and badly needed. But without followers, there can be no leaders.Effective leaders are not those who are loved or admired. They are those whose followers do the right things.
