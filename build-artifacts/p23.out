“There are many of us that are willing to do great things for the Lord, but few of us are willing to do little things.”  – D.L. Moody, General Conference
“I mistrust the judgment of every man in a case in which his own wishes are concerned.”  – First Duke of Wellington, General Conference
“When your thinking rises above concern for your own welfare, wisdom which is independent of thought appears.”  – Ha Gakure, General Conference
“In this world it is not what we take up, but what we give up, that makes us rich.”  – Henry Ward Beecher, General Conference
“A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog.”  – Jack London, General Conference
“When a child gets what he wants, you can be sure he is well on the way toward delinquency.”  – Kenneth W. Lund, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Increase of material comforts, it may be generally laid down, does not in any way whatsoever conduce to moral growth.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“The mice which helplessly find themselves between the cats teeth acquire no merit from their enforced sacrifice.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“I ask you one thing: do not tire of giving, but do not give your leftovers. Give until it hurts, until you feel the pain.”  – Mother Teresa, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“The charitable give out the door and God puts it back through the window.”  – Proverb, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Money often costs too much.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Loyalty means nothing unless it has at its heart the absolute principle of self-sacrifice.”  – Woodrow Wilson, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“The Bible, when it is understood, is one of the simplest books in the world, for, as far as it is translated correctly, it is nothing but truth, and in truth there is no mystery save to the ignorant.”  – Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses
“One of the great compliments paid the Savior was that he taught as one having authority. The missionary who knows scripture and can quote it speaks with the voice of authority...May I suggest that in our family night gatherings we make it a project to memorize one scripture a week pertinent to this work. At the conclusion of a year our children will have on their lips a fund of scripture which will remain with them throughout their lives.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, CR
“True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. Preoccupation with unworthy behavior can lead to unworthy behavior. That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel.”  – Boyd K. Packer, General Conference
“True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.”  – Boyd K. Packer, Ensign
“Because we believe that scripture reading can help us receive revelation, we are encouraged to read the scriptures again and again. By this means, we obtain access to what our Heavenly Father would have us know and do in our personal lives today. That is one reason Latter-day Saints believe in daily scripture study. Similarly, what a scripture in the Book of Mormon meant to me when I first read it at age sixteen is not conclusive upon me as I read it at age sixty. With the benefit of my life's experiences and with my greater familiarity with revelation, I can learn things that were not available to me yesterday by reading the scriptures today.”  – Dallin H. Oaks, Ensign
“More than at any time in our history we have need for greater spirituality. The way to develop greater spirituality is to feast on the words of Christ as revealed in the scriptures. One of the most significant happenings in recent Church history is the publication of the new editions of the standard works with the new footnotes and other helps. I think we can say without exaggeration that never before in any dispensation have the Saints been so abundantly blessed with the words of the Lord and His prophets. Now our challenge is to do as the Lord commanded: 'Study my word which hath gone forth among the children of men' (D&C 11:22).”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“Success in righteousness, the power to avoid deception and resist temptation, guidance in our daily lives, healing of the soul - these are but a few of the promises the Lord has given to those who will come to His word. Does the Lord promise and not fulfill? Surely if He tells us that these things will come to us if we lay hold upon His word, then the blessings can be ours. And if we do not, then the blessings may be lost. However diligent we may be in other areas, certain blessings are to be found only in the scriptures, only in coming to the word of the Lord and holding fast to it as we make our way through the mists of darkness to the tree of life.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Ensign
“Those who delve into the scriptural library ... find that to understand requires more than casual reading or perusal - there must be concentrated study. It is certain that one who studies the scriptures every day accomplishes far more than one who devotes considerable time one day and then lets days go by before continuing. Not only should we study each day, but there should be a regular time set aside when we can concentrate without interference. There is nothing more helpful than prayer to open our understanding of the scriptures. Through prayer we can attune our minds to seek the answers to our searchings...Many find that the best time to study is in the morning after a night's rest has cleared the mind of the many cares that interrupt thought. Others prefer to study in the quiet hours after the work and worries of the day are over and brushed aside, thus ending the day with a peace and tranquillity that comes by communion with the scriptures. Perhaps what is more important than the hour of the day is that a regular time be set aside for study. It would be ideal if an hour could be spent each day; but if that much cannot be had, a half hour on a regular basis would result in substantial accomplishment. A quarter of an hour is little time, but it is surprising how much enlightenment and knowledge can be acquired in a subject so meaningful. The important thing is to allow nothing else to ever interfere with our study.”  – Howard W. Hunter, General Conference
“An effort must be put forth to learn the gospel, to understand it, to comprehend the relationship of its principles. The gospel must be studied, otherwise no test of its truth may sanely be applied to it. That study must be wide, for the gospel is so organized that in it is a place for every truth, of every name and nature. That study must be constantly continued, for the content of the gospel is illimitable.”  – John A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations
“...it is desirable that our children should learn to memorize important passages; such that will leave a strong impression upon their lives; scriptural passages that they will use as their guiding star; scriptural passages that will help to form convictions in their minds of right and wrong; scriptural passages that will bring conviction to their hearts”  – Joseph M. Tanner, General Conference
“In all of the history of mankind there has never been a time when we have had a greater opportunity to increase our knowledge of the law of the Lord...Surely there can be no excuse for us not to become the best informed generation of all time in our knowledge of the scriptures. Never before have we had opportunity such as we have today to become real gospel scholars.”  – L. Tom Perry, General Conference
“We are saddened to learn as we travel about the stakes and missions of the Church that there are still many of the saints who are not reading and pondering the scriptures regularly and have little knowledge of the Lord's instructions to the children of men. Many have been baptized and received a testimony, and have 'gotten into this straight and narrow path,' yet have failed to take the further required step -- to 'press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end.' (2 Nephi 31:19,20). One cannot become a 'doer' of the word without first becoming a 'hearer.' And to become a 'hearer' is not simply to stand idly by and wait for chance bits of information, it is too seek out and study and pray and comprehend. Therefore, the Lord said, 'Whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with my voice, and is not of me' (D&C 84:52).”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Ensign
“Any intelligent man may learn what he wants to learn. He may acquire knowledge in any field, though it requires much thought and effort. It takes more than a decade to get a high school diploma; it takes an additional four years for most people to get a college degree; it takes nearly a quarter-century to become a great physician. Why, oh, why do people think they can fathom the most complex spiritual depths without the necessary experimental and laboratory work accompanied by compliance with the laws that govern it? Absurd it is, but you will frequently find popular personalities, who seem never to have lived a single law of God, discoursing in interviews on religion. How ridiculous for such persons to attempt to outline for the world a way of life! And yet many a financier, politician, college professor, or owner of a gambling club thinks that because he has risen above all his fellowmen in his particular field he knows everything in every field. One cannot know God nor understand his works or plans unless he follows the laws which govern. The spiritual realm, which is just as absolute as is the physical, cannot be understood by the laws of the physical. You do not learn to make electric generators in a seminary. Neither do you learn certain truths about spiritual things in a physics laboratory. You must go to the spiritual laboratory, use the facilities available there, and comply with the governing rules. Then you may know of these truths just as surely, or more surely, than the scientist knows the metals, or the acids, or other elements. It matters little whether one is a plumber, or a banker, or a farmer, for these occupations are secondary; what is most important is what one knows and believes concerning his past and his future and what he does about it.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Absolute Truth
“If you pray for an angel to visit you, you know what he'll do if he comes. He'll just quote the scriptures to you - so you know you're wasting your time waiting for what we already have. I'm quite serious about that.”  – Hugh Nibley, Of All Things
“The man who does not read books has no advantage over the man that can not read them.”  – Mark Twain, Of All Things
“People cannot be well educated without the Bible.”  – Nott, Of All Things
“We do not have to make the Bible relevant -- it already is! But we do have to show its relevance.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“The depth of the Christian Scriptures is boundless. Even if I were attempting to study them and nothing else, from boyhood to decrepit old age, with the utmost leisure, the most unwearied zeal, and with talents greater than I possess, I would still be making progress in discovering their treasures.”  – Saint Augustine, The Purpose Driven Church
“Side by Side (Poem). On the table, side by side the Book of Mormon and the TV guide. One is well worn and cherished with pride; not the Book of Mormon, but the TV guide. One is used daily to help folks decide; no, not the Book of Mormon, but the TV guide. As the pages are turned, what will they see? Oh, what does it matter, turn on the TV! So they open the book from which they confide; No, not the Book of Mormon, but the TV guide. The word of God is seldom read maybe a verse or two before they fall into bed, exhausted and sleepy and tired as can be, not from reading the scriptures, but from watching TV. So back to the table, side by side the Book of Mormon, and the TV guide. The plan of salvation is full and free but is found in the scriptures, not on TV.”  – Unknown, The Purpose Driven Church
“To say nothing of its holiness or authenticity, the Bible contains more specimens of genius and taste than any other volume in existence.”  – Walter S. Landor, The Purpose Driven Church
“As couple missionaries, you and your wife should prepare to serve when that time comes. We need many, many more couple missionaries.”  – Earl C. Tingey, General Conference
“Become involved in missionary service. We need increasing numbers of senior missionaries in missionary service. Where health and means make it possible, we call upon hundreds more of our couples to set their lives and affairs in order and to go on missions. How we need you in the mission field! You are able to perform missionary service in ways that our younger missionaries cannot. I'm grateful that two of my own widowed sisters were able to serve as missionary companions together in England. They were sixty-eight and seventy-three years of age when they were called, and they both had a marvelous experience. What an example and a blessing it is to a family's posterity when grandparents serve missions. Most senior couples who go are strengthened and revitalized by missionary service. Through this holy avenue of service, many are sanctified and feel the joy of bringing others to the knowledge of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Come Listen to a Prophet's Voice
“Emerson said that every great institution is but the lengthened shadow of a great person. The power is in us, in each of us - the power to do significant acts of service on our own initiative if we will become anxiously engaged.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Faith
“God loves the world through us.”  – Mother Teresa, Faith
“One of the most important and rewarding ways in which we can serve our fellowmen is by living and sharing the principles of the gospel. We need to help those whom we seek to serve to know for themselves that God not only loves them but he is ever mindful of them and their needs. To teach our neighbors of the divinity of the gospel is a command reiterated by the Lord: 'It becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor' (D&C 88:81).”  – Spencer W. Kimball, New Era
“A man is truly ethical only when he obeys the compulsion to help all life which he is able to assist, and shrinks from injuring anything that lives.”  – Albert Schweitzer, New Era
“If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.”  – Chinese Proverb, New Era
“Behave toward everyone as if receiving a great guest.”  – Confucius, New Era
“When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it.”  – E. W. Howe, New Era
“A man with a surplus can control circumstances, but a man without a surplus is controlled by them, and often has no opportunity to exercise judgment.”  – Harvey S. Firestone, New Era
“You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love.”  – Henry Drummond, New Era
“Only by giving are you able to receive more than you already have.”  – Jim Rohn, New Era
“Sharing makes you bigger than you are. The more you pour out, the more life will be able to pour in.”  – Jim Rohn, New Era
“Somebody says, 'Well, I can't be concerned about other people. About the best I can do is to take care of myself.' Well, then you will always be poor.”  – Jim Rohn, New Era
“Maybe if I had not picked up that one person dying on the street, I would not have picked up the thousands.”  – Mother Teresa, New Era
“Never say anything to hurt anyone. Moreover refrain from double talk, from shrewd and canny remarks that are designed to advance our interests at someone's disadvantage. We are to turn our back upon evil, and in every way possible, do good, help people and bring blessings into their lives.”  – Norman Vincent Peale, New Era
“If you would lift me up you must be on higher ground.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, New Era
