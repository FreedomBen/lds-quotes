“I may know that the Gospel is true, and my wife may know it; but I do not imagine for one moment that my children will be born with this knowledge. We receive a testimony of the Gospel by obeying the laws and ordinances thereof; and our children will receive that knowledge exactly the same way; and if we do not teach them, and they do not walk in the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life, they will never receive this knowledge.”  – Heber J. Grant, Collected Discourses
“People should study the gospel. But the greatest testimony we can receive is the voice of revelation -- the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. No one can get this without living it.”  – Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards
“As a vital link in the conversion process, we should bear our testimonies that the gospel is true; our testimonies may well be the spark that ignites the conversion process.

Kimball, Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball

“Whatever a man does he must do first in his mind.”  – Albert Szent-Gyorgi, LDS Church News
“How rarely it occurs to anyone to use his mind in a new way to make his life a better life. Inquire whether your thinking is true, healthy, necessary, sincere, pleasant. A man who would not eat unhealthy foods not only consumes but welcomes unhealthy thoughts. A good reason for removing errors of thinking is that we will cease to suffer from them. A mind living in a prison of its own making has the ability to become its own key to liberty.”  – Vernon Howard, LDS Church News
“The first deviation toward moral breakdown in a man or woman is similar to a spark that ignites a devastating forest fire...We risk similar damage to our moral integrity when we let our guard down for even one brief moment.

“The 80/20 rule states that 80% of your results will come from 20% of your activities.
