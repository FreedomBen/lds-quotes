“I take it to be a principle rule of life, not to be too much addicted to any one thing.”  – Terence, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Moderation in temper is always a virtue; but moderation in principle is always a vice.”  – Thomas Paine, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins...”  – Joseph Smith, Fourth Article of Faith
“Young men, the Book of Mormon will change your life. It will fortify you against the evil of our day. It will bring spirituality into your life that no other book will. It will be the most important book that you will read in preparation for a mission and for life. A young man who knows and loves the Book of Mormon, who has read it several times, who has an abiding testimony of its truthfulness, and who applies its teachings will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and will be a mighty tool in the hands of the Lord.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, To Young Men of the Priesthood
“When you get into the active operation of your proselyting program, this is a concept you absolutely must have. It has been our traditional course in days past, unfortunately all too frequently, to say, 'Here is the Bible, and the Bible says this and this, and therefore the Gospel has been restored.' Well now, there is no person on earth that believes the Bible more than I do. I read it and ponder its words. I know that what is in it is true. But let me tell you, it is not the Bible that brings people into the Church; it is the Book of Mormon and latter-day revelation. We can use the Bible to lay a foundation, and to point people's attention to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, but until we get involved with latter-day revelation, the process of conversion does not begin to operate in any substantial degree in the heart of an investigator. The Lord said to Joseph Smith: 'this generation shall have my word through you...' (D&C 5:10). That is his decree. They either get it through Joseph Smith or they do not get it, and our whole perspective is: Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith.”  – Bruce R. McConkie, Mission Presidents Seminar
“A great challenge and day of preparation is at hand for missionaries to meet and teach with the Book of Mormon. We need missionaries to match our message.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Regional Representatives Seminar
“A missionary who is inspired by the Spirit of the Lord must be led by that Spirit to choose the proper approach to be effective. We must not forget that the Lord Himself provided the Book of Mormon as His chief witness. The Book of Mormon is still our most powerful missionary tool. Let us use it.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson
“The Book of Mormon must be the heart of our missionary work in every mission of the Church if we are to come out from under this condemnation (see D&C 84:56-57). And what a marvelous missionary tool it is! Already we see an increase in baptisms, which testifies to the power of this sacred volume.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Mission Presidents Seminar
“We need to flood the earth with the Book of Mormon.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Mission Presidents Seminar
“Would not the progress of the Church increase dramatically today with an increasing number of those who are spiritually reborn? Can you imagine what would happen in our homes? Can you imagine what would happen with an increasing number of copies of the Book of Mormon in the hands of an increasing number of missionaries who know how to use it and who have been born of God? When this happens, we will get the bounteous harvest of souls that the Lord promised. It was the 'born of God' Alma who as a missionary was so able to impart the word that many others were also born of God. (See Alma 36:23-26.)”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Mission Presidents Seminar
“You know of my great love for the Book of Mormon. Sister Benson and I try to read it every morning, and we have a great love for that book. The Book of Mormon is the instrument that God has designed to 'sweep the earth as with a flood, to gather out His elect unto the New Jerusalem.' This sacred volume of scripture has not been, nor is it yet, central in our preaching, our teaching, and our missionary work.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Speech or conversation
“I cannot understand how any intelligent man could think that anyone without the help of the Lord could have produced the Book of Mormon, which has been before us now for more than a hundred years and has stood the test during all that period of time, notwithstanding the ridicule that has been brought against it, for one reason or another. Today that book, which was translated by Joseph Smith as the instrumentality of the Lord, stands out supreme. It is today the greatest missionary that we have for proclaiming this gospel; there is nothing else to compare with it.”  – Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards
“I counsel you, my beloved brothers and sisters and friends everywhere, to make reading the Book of Mormon a few minutes each day a lifelong practice. All of us need the uninterrupted association with the Spirit of the Lord. We need to take the Holy Spirit for our constant guide that we be not deceived. I am persuaded by my own experience and that of my loved ones, as well as by the statements of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that one can get and keep closer to the Lord by reading the Book of Mormon than by reading any other book. Don't be content with what someone else tells you about what is in it. Drink deeply from the divine fountain itself.”  – Marion G. Romney, General Conference
“I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity - the pure love of Christ - will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.”  – Marion G. Romney, General Conference
“Wear the old coat and buy the new book.”  – Austin Phelps, General Conference
“Everybody know how to read and nobody knows what to read.”  – George Bernard Shaw, General Conference
“Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them all.”  – Henry David Thoreau, General Conference
“One half who graduate from college never read another book.”  – Herbert True, General Conference
“A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.”  – Mark Twain, General Conference
“The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them.”  – Mark Twain, General Conference
“The books that help you the most are those that make you think the most.”  – Theodore Parker, General Conference
“The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers.”  – Thomas Jefferson, General Conference
“If you will ponder it in your mind, you will come up, in my judgment, with the conclusion that we could bring immeasurably more people into the Church than we are now doing. We could fellowship more than we are now fellowshipping; in practice this could be five or ten or twenty times as many as we are now baptizing. Perhaps in due course it should be 24 times or 100 times as many as at present.”  – Bruce R. McConkie, Mission Presidents' Seminar
“We are not getting the results we ought to get. We are not getting the numbers of baptisms that in my judgment the Lord expects us to get. To a degree, at least, we are grinding our wheels without going forward...Perhaps what is wrong is that we have not desired faith with all our hearts to bring souls into the kingdom. Perhaps we have not made up our minds that we can and will bring people into the Church. Now, very frankly, whether we gain many converts or few depends in large measure upon our frame of mind.”  – Bruce R. McConkie, Mission Presidents' Seminar
“I have a vision of thousands of missionaries going into the mission field with hundreds of passages memorized from the Book of Mormon so that they might feed the needs of a spiritually famished world.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“The Lord calls nobody to fail, but to succeed; and they [missionaries] should understand this fully.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, New Mission Presidents' Seminar
“Missionary work is different in nature than any other position, and is a great privilege and blessing to be involved in, and a very small gift to give. Missionary work is the payment of a tithe of your life to the advancement of the work of God in all the world...Missionaries who are prayerful, obedient and who work hard will be given some measure of harvest, for which you will be grateful all the days of your life...You will never be able to judge the consequences of that which you do as a missionary...If you bring someone into the Church and that individual stays in the Church, the harvest will go on and on, growing and growing through the years and through generations of time...We place tremendous confidence in you. We count on you to do a superb job. No less than the best will do. You must do your very, very best.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“We are thrilled with the increase in baptisms, but we know we've only scratched the surface of what we are capable of doing.”  – Robert L. Backman, LDS Church News
“Now, my brothers and sisters, it seems clear to me, indeed, this impression weighs upon me--that the Church is at a point in its growth and maturity when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way. Some decisions have been made and others pending, which will clear the way, organizationally. But the basic decisions needed for us to move forward, as a people, must be made by the individual members of the Church. The major strides which must be made by the Church will follow upon the major strides to be made by us as individuals.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, General Conference
“We want missionaries who have the kind of faith that Wilford Woodruff and Heber C. Kimball had each bringing hundreds and thousands of souls into the waters of baptisms.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, General Conference
“We can only change the world by changing men.”  – Charles Wells, General Conference
“The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world's problem.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, General Conference
“I think that the work of the Church in the developed and rich Western Hemisphere is more difficult than in Calcutta, South Yemen, or other areas where the needs of the people are reduced to the clothes needed to ward off the cold, or a dish of rice to curb their hinger -- anything that will show them that someone loves them. In the West the problems that people have go much deeper; the problems are in the depths of our hearts.”  – Mother Teresa, General Conference
“In the developed countries there is a poverty of intimacy, a poverty of spirit, of loneliness, of lack of love. There is no greater sickness in the world today than that one.”  – Mother Teresa, General Conference
“There are two kinds of fools. One says, 'This is old therefore it is good.' The other one says, 'This is new therefore it is better.'”  – Dean William R. Inge, General Conference
“Don't ever take a fence down, until you know why it was put up.”  – Robert Frost, General Conference
“A person's reaction to his appetites and impulses when they are aroused gives the measure of that person's character.”  – David O. McKay, General Conference
“The virtue of man ought to be measured, not by his extraordinary exertions, but by his everyday conduct.”  – Blaise Pascal, General Conference
“Money is not required to buy one necessity of the soul.”  – Henry David Thoreau, General Conference

“Nothing teaches character better than generosity.”  – Jim Rohn, General Conference
“Character is much easier kept than recovered.”  – Thomas Paine, General Conference
“If you think about what you ought to do for other people, your character will take care of itself.”  – Woodrow Wilson, General Conference
“Let us consider youth as grouped into three classes according to their degree of aspiration: (1) First in their degree of aspiration: The 'Infusoria' class in which falls the listless, drifting youth. Down among the lowest types of living creatures, there is a little animal that moves about randomly and aimlessly...The Infusoria enter upon life aimlessly, and ninety-nine out of one hundred of these animals perish in consequence... (2) Higher in the scale of intelligence and uplift, there are those who may be classed as the 'firefly men'. Often on a summer's evening you perhaps observed as children what we used to call the 'lightening bug.' These flying creatures seemed most active just before a shower. The light from each would shine but for an instant, then the thing would be absorbed in the darkness. Another momentary flash, then blackness again. Such is the 'Firefly' youth with respect to noble aspiration. He has luminous hours in which his soul ardently desires to rise above all things mean and sordid, and to bask in the realm of enlightenment and beauty. He would be valiant and courageous in defending virtue and right under all circumstances. If he could only obtain strength and power, he would use them to help his fellowmen and make the world better! But when a few hours later he associates with his companions unfired by such noble ideals, the light of his aspiration fades, the fires of enthusiasm die, and his soul is absorbed in the darkness of indifference. However, it is better to have hoped and yearned for better things and had the hopes fade, then never to have yearned at all. The flicker at least shows the presence of a light that might be fanned into a constant flame. That is better than damp driftwood from which will come not even a spark. (3) Then there is the third group, which I call the 'Conifer' youth. In using this term, I have in mind not just the ordinary cone-bearing tree of the Conifer group, but particularly, the Giant Sequoia...Among them is one, 'The General Sherman,' which is estimated to be 3500 years old. It has withstood lightning, floods, fire and still lives on. It has survived because in it is the power of resistance. The 'Conifer' youth senses the fact that man is not just a mere animal, but is rather a spiritual being. He realizes that he is more than a physical object that is tossed for a short time from bank to bank, only to be submerged in the ever-flowing stream of life. There is something within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical, and to live in a higher and more beautiful world.”  – David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life
“The real test of any church or religion is the kind of men it makes.”  – David O. McKay, CR
