“We must always be careful to avoid the two extreme positions in ministry. One extreme is to assume all responsibility for the growth of the church.

Both are fatal to a church.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church

“Many simplistic solution for church growth are couched in such pious terms that it makes it difficult for anyone to challenge them without seeming unspiritual. Somebody needs to boldly state the obvious: Prayer alone will not grow a church. Some of the greatest prayer warriors I know are pastors and members of dying churches. Of course, prayer is absolutely essential...A prayerless ministry is a powerless ministry. But it takes far more than prayer to grow a church. It takes skilled action. One time God told Joshua to stop praying about his failure and get up and correct the cause of it instead (Joshua 7). There is a time to pray, and there is a time to act responsibly.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
