“Missionaries should have goals but they should not be imposed by the mission president, his assistants or the zone leaders. I am persuaded that the missionaries will be more dedicated to their work, will be more committed, if they have set their own goals, and happier in their labors than if goals are imposed upon them. The best motivation is self-motivation.”  – James E. Faust, New Mission Presidents' Seminar
“Our goals should stretch us bit by bit. So often when we think we have encountered a ceiling, it is really a psychological or experimental barrier that we have built ourselves. We built it and we can remove it. Just as correct principles, when applied, carry their own witness that they are true, so do correct personal improvement programs. But we must not expect personal improvement without pain or some 'remodeling.' We can't expect to have the thrills of revealed religion without the theology. We cannot expect to have the soul stretching without Christian service.”  – Neal A. Maxwell, Deposition of a Disciple

Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar

Now there's a tremendous difference between a goal and a quota...We hope that every one of you will have a goal and have a goal every month.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar

“In the long run men hit only what they aim at.”  – Henry David Thoreau, Regional Representatives Seminar

“It has been claimed that God was without form, even though the holy Scriptures teach that God created man in his own image. In fact, we are told by Paul the apostle that Jesus Christ was in the express image of his Father. Are we then created in the image of a formless entity? For us, God is not an abstraction. He is not an idea, a metaphysical principle, an impersonal force or power. He is a concrete, living person. And though in our human frailty we cannot know the total mystery of his being, we know that he is akin to us, for he is revealed to us in the divine personality of his Son, Jesus Christ, and he is, in fact, our Father.”  – Hugh B. Brown, Conference Report

Romney, Conference Report
“Gratitude is the heart's memory.”  – French Proverb, Conference Report
