“I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is Christmas about sense, anyway?  It is about a child, of long ago and far away, and it is about the child of now.  In you and me.

A child who is impractical, unrealistic, simpleminded and terribly vulnerable to joy.”  – Robert Fulghum, All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten

“If you desire to find the true spirit of Christmas and partake of the sweetness of it, let me make this suggestion to you.  During the hurry of the festive occasion of this Christmas season, find time to turn your heart to God.  Perhaps in the quiet hours, and in a quiet place, and on your knees—alone or with loved ones—give thanks for the good things that have come to you, and ask that His Spirit might dwell in you as you earnestly strive to serve Him and keep His commandments.  He will take you by the hand and His promises will be kept.”  – Howard W. Hunter

“The Christmas presents once opened are Not So Much Fun as they were while we were in the process of examining, lifting, shaking, thinking about, and opening them.

Are you willing to do these things for a day?  Then you are ready to keep Christmas!”  – Henry van Dyke, Goo
