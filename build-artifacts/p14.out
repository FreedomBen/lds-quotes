“Common sense is as rare as genius.”  – Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Second Corinthians 13:5 says, 'Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.' How does a church evaluate itself?

“Growing churches focus on reaching receptive people. Nongrowing churches focus on reenlisting inactive people...It usually takes about five times more energy to reactivate a disgruntled or carnal member than it does to win a receptive unbeliever.

“Often the local pastor and I would spend the afternoons making evangelistic house calls. Many times the pastor would take me to toe same stubborn case that previous evangelists had failed to win. It was a waste of time. Is it good stewardship to continue badgering someone who has already rejected Christ a dozen times when there is a whole community of receptive people waiting to hear the gospel for the first time?...The apostle Paul's strategy was to go through open doors and not waste time banging on closed ones. Likewise, we should not focus our efforts on those who aren't ready to listen. There are far more people in the world who are ready to receive Christ than there are believers ready to witness to them.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
