“To call women the weaker sex is a libel: it is man's injustice to woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then indeed, is woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man's superior.

If non-violence is the law of our being, the future is with women.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, Young India

Cannon, CR
