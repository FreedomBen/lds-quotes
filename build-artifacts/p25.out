“When I am....completely myself, entirely alone...or during the night when I cannot sleep, it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly. Whence and how these come I know not nor can I force them...Nor do I hear in my imagination the parts successively, but I hear them gleich alles zusammen [at the same time all together].”  – Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Discourses of Wilford Woodruff

“In teaching there are three ever-present factors: first, what the teacher is; secondly, what the teacher says; and thirdly, what the teacher does. The least important of these is what the teacher says; the other two are most vital in child training. It is worse folly for a teacher to attempt to teach something which he himself does not believe. There is a sixth sense in most of us, and particularly in children and youth, which instinctively detects the inconsistency between pretension as expressed in words and reality as it exists in thought and feeling. A dishonest teacher cannot effectively teach honesty, nor an athiest teach belief in God, nor an immoral one teach purity of life. True teaching springs from the heart, not from vocal chords.”  – David O. McKay, Secrets of a Happy Life
“No greater responsibility can rest upon a man, than to be a teacher of God's children”  – David O. McKay, General Conference

Fourth, that all the presidents of the Church since Joseph Smith have been successors to the keys of the authority that Joseph Smith restored. Fifth, President Gordon B. Hinckley is the prophet, seer and revelator to the world at this time.'”  – James E. Faust, New Mission Presidents' Seminar
“The question often arises in the minds of young men who find themselves in the mission field, 'What shall I say?' And another follows closely upon it, 'How shall I say it?'...While no specific rule may be given, experience has taught that the simplest way is the best. Having learned the principles of the gospel, through a prayerful spirit and by careful study, these should be presented to men in humility, in the simplest forms of speach, without presumption or arrogance and in the spirit of the mission of Christ...The gospel is not successfully taught by ostentatious display of words and argument, but rather is expressed by modest and rational statements of its simple truth, uttered in a way that will touch the heart and appeal, as well, to reason and sound sense.”  – Joseph Fielding Smith, Gospel Doctrine
“Who can I preach to, but my friends?”  – Joseph Smith, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith

“People need fewer 'ought-to' sermons and more 'how-to' sermons.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“Some pastors actually think they have failed in their preaching if people enjoy a message. I've heard pastors proudly say, 'We're not here to entertain.' Obviously they're doing a good job.

A sermon does not have to be dry to be spiritual.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church

“The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.”  – William A. Ward, The Purpose Driven Church
“Let us be a temple-attending and a temple-loving people. Let us hasten to the temple as frequently as time and means and personal circumstances allow. Let us go not only for our kindred dead, but let us also go for the personal blessing of temple worship, for the sanctity and safety which is provided within those hallowed and consecrated walls. The temple is a place of beauty, it is a place of revelation, it is a place of peace. It is the house of the Lord. It is holy unto the Lord. It should be holy unto us.”  – Howard W. Hunter, Ensign
“Truly, the Lord desires that His people be a temple-motivated people. It would be the deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the Church be temple worthy. I would hope that every adult member would be worthy of - and carry - a current temple recommend, even if proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or frequent use of it.”  – Howard W. Hunter, Ensign

“This thing which we call testimony is the great strength of the Church. It is the wellspring of faith and activity. It is difficult to quantify. It is an elusive and mysterious thing, and yet it is as real and powerful as any force on the earth...Personal testimony is the factor which turns people around in their living as they come into this Church. This is the element which motivates the membership to forsake all in the service of the Lord. This is the quiet, encouraging voice which sustains without pause those who walk in faith down to the last days of their lives.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“Testimony isn't something you have today, and you are going to have always. A testimony is fragile. It is as hard to hold as a moonbeam. It is something you have to recapture every day of your life.”  – Harold B. Lee, July 15
