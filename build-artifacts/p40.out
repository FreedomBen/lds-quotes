“We desire all potential members to be friendshipped. Our youth should be involved in missionary work. Some of our finest converts come through the young people of the Church.

Hinckley, Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson

“The Latter-day Saints, I hold, will be held to stricter accountability than any other people on the face of the earth. Men wonder why we have suffered and been persecuted so much in the past. I think it was partly because of our hardness of heart. Not that the men who persecuted us were justified in so doing. They were tested and tried, the Lord left them their agency and they brought themselves under condemnation because of their conduct. But we never had anything descend upon us as a persecution or scourge that has not been intended for our good; and we are held to a stricter accountability than any other people because we have the Gospel taught unto us.”  – George Q. Cannon, JDS
“You never can foretell the consequences of your work as a missionary in this Church.  You don't know what will come of it.

Hinckley, Ensign
