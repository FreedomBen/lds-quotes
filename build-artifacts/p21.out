“The tragedy of man is what dies inside himself while he still lives.”  – Albert Schweitzer, The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff
“To be always intending to live a new life, but never to find time to set about it; this is as if a man should put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day and night to another, till he is starved and destroyed.”  – John Tillotson, The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff
“Infinite toil would not enable you to sweep away a mist; but by ascending a little you may often look over it altogether. So it is with our moral improvement; we wrestle fiercely with a vicious habit, which would have no hold upon us if we ascended into a higher moral atmosphere.”  – Sir Arthur Helps, The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff

“Let us take a course to be saved today, and, when evening comes, review the acts of the day, repent of our sins, if we have any to repent of, and say our prayers; then we can lie down and sleep in peace until the morning, arise with gratitude to God, commence the labors of another day, and strive to live the whole day to God and nobody else.”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“Oh, ye elders of Israel, hearken to my voice; and when you are sent into the world to preach, tell those things you are sent to tell; preach and cry aloud, 'Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent and believe the Gospel.' Declare the first principles, and let mysteries alone, lest ye be overthrown. Never meddle with the visions of beasts and subjects you do not understand. Elder Brown, when you go to Palmyra, say nothing about the four beasts, but preach those things the Lord has told you to preach about-repentance and baptism for the remission of sins.”  – Joseph Smith, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“Repentance is a thing that cannot be trifled with every day. Daily transgression and daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God.”  – Joseph Smith, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“Just because we have taken one step down the wrong road is no reason why we have to take two.”  – Richard L. Evans, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Self-justification is the enemy to repentance. God's spirit continues with the honest in heart to strengthen, to help, and to save, but invariably the Spirit of God ceases to strive with the man who 'excuses' himself in his wrong doing. Practically all dishonesty owes its continued existence and growth to this inward distortion we call 'self-justification.' It is the first, the worst and most insidious and damaging. form of cheating - cheating ourselves.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, BYU Speeches
“They were very disturbed when their marriage was postponed to allow time for repentance. They had rationalized the sin nearly out of existence. They pressed for a date, the first possible one on which they could plan their temple marriage. They did not understand that forgiveness is not a thing of days or months or even years but is a matter of intensity of feeling and transformation of self.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, BYU Speeches
“True repentance does not permit repetition.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, LDS Speaker's Sourcebook

“A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it is committing another mistake.”  – Confucius, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.”  – Confucius, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“No explanation ever explains the necessity of making one.”  – Elbert Hubbard, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“A reputation once broken may possibly be repaired, but the world will always keep their eyes on the spot where the crack was.”  – Joseph Hall, The Missionary's Little Quote Book
“Confession of error is like a broom that sweeps away the dirt and leaves the surface cleaner than before.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, The Missionary's Little Quote Book

“Great is the difference betwixt a man's being frightened at, and humbled for his sins.”  – Thomas Fuller, The Missionary's Little Quote Book

“Since baptism is essential there must be an urgent concern to carry the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. That came as a commandment from Him...We accept the responsibility to preach the gospel to every person on earth. And if the question is asked, 'You mean you are out to convert the entire world?' the answer is, 'Yes. We will try to reach every living soul.' Some who measure that challenge quickly say, 'Why, that's impossible! It cannot be done!' To that we simply say, 'Perhaps, but we shall do it anyway.'”  – Boyd K. Packer, General Conference
“...serve the Lord with cheerfulness and singleness of heart. You need not expect salvation, unless you can administer the same salvation to others, both in precept and example.”  – Brigham Young, DBY
“I wish to make this request: that the Elders who return from missions consider themselves just as much on a mission here as in England or in any other part of the world... We frequently call the brethren to go on missions to preach the gospel, and they will go and labor as faithfully as men can do, fervent in spirit, in prayer, in laying on hands, in preaching to and teaching the people how to be saved. In a few years they come home, and throwing off their coats and hats will say, Religion, stand aside, I am going to work now to get something for myself and my family. This is folly in the extreme. When a man returns from a mission where he has been preaching the Gospel he ought to be just as ready to come to this pulpit to preach as if he were in England, France, Germany, or on the islands of the sea. And when he has been at home a week, a month, a year, or ten years, the spirit of preaching and the spirit of the gospel ought to be within him like a river flowing forth to the people in good words, teachings, precepts, and examples. If this is not the case he does not fill his mission.”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“The purpose of our life should be to build up the Zion of our God, to gather the House of Israel, bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, restore and bless the earth with our ability and make it as the Garden of Eden, store up treasures of knowledge and wisdom in our own understandings, purify our own hearts and prepare a people to meet the Lord when he comes.”  – Brigham Young, DBY
“There is neither man nor woman in this Church who is not on a mission. That mission will last as long as they live, and it is to do good, to promote righteousness, to teach the principles of truth, and to prevail upon themselves and everybody around them to live those principles that they may obtain eternal life.”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“We live in that day, the day when the harvest is ripe. We have deluded ourselves long enough that this is a day of gleaning only. This is not a day of gleaning but of harvest.”  – Bruce R. McConkie, Mission Presidents Seminar
“As members of the Lord's Church, we must take missionary work more seriously. The Lord's commission to 'preach the gospel to every creature' (Mark 16:15) will never change in our dispensation. We have been greatly blessed with the material means, the technology, and an inspired message to bring the gospel to all men. More is expected of us than any previous generation. Where 'much is given much is required.' (D&C 82:3.)”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“How do you build in boys a great desire to serve? You do not wait until they are nineteen years old to help them decide to serve a mission. You help them decide to go when they are nine, teen, or eleven! The home is the seedbed for the preparation of young men. And every young man should be prepared in his home to serve. Early preparation consists of teaching a young boy how to pray, reading him stories from the Book of Mormon and other scriptures, having home evenings and giving him a portion of the lesson, teaching him principles of moral cleanliness, starting a savings account for his future mission, teaching him how to work, and providing opportunities to serve others. I know of families who always prayed in family prayer that their sons would be worthy to serve missions. This, they say, had a great effect on their sons. For our teenage young men and women, one of the best preparations for a mission is provided by the Church through seminary and institute of religion classes. We hope you will urge your children to take part in this inspired program.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“It is not enough to be sincere. We must be right.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, General Conference
“New missionaries need to know exactly the purpose for being in the mission field, which is to save souls, to baptize converts, to bring families into the church.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, New Mission Presidents Seminar
“The Lord wants every young man to serve a full-time mission. Currently, only a fifth of the eligible young men in the Church are serving full-time missions. This is not pleasing to the Lord. We can do better. We must do better.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Come
“You can do nothing more important. School can wait. Scholarships can be deferred. Occupational goals can be postponed. Yes, even temple marriage should wait until after a young man has served an honorable full-time mission for the Lord. And I would admonish you to date only faithful young women who also believe this and give you that encouragement.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, To the Young Men of the Church
“Young men, look forward to full-time missionary service. Show your love and commitment to the Lord by responding to His call to serve. Know that the real purpose in going into the mission field is to bring souls unto Christ, to teach and baptize our Heavenly Father's children so that you may rejoice with them in the kingdom of our Father. (See D&C 18:15.) Prepare now for your mission by doing these things we have discussed this evening.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, To the Young Men of the Church
“'Behold how great is your calling' (D&C 112:33). How great is your calling! You are not sent here to take pictures. You are not sent here to play. You are sent here to find and teach. That's our opportunity, our challenge, and our responsibility. You'll never rise higher in all your lives than you will do while you are in the mission field. That may sound like a strange thing. I said that once in Argentina many years ago, and about ten years later I received a letter from a young man who said, 'When I was on a mission in Argentina, you came there and you put a hex on me. I haven't been able to lift it. I have been no good ever since. I failed in school, I failed in my work, I failed in my marriage.' I didn't put a hex on him. I simply told him that he would never stand taller, never rise higher, than while in the service of the Lord, and his subsequent life demonstrated that.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley
“But all of us acknowledge that we have barely scratched the surface. We have a mandate laid upon us from which we cannot shrink. It is the charge from the Lord Himself to teach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The field is white, but the laborers are relatively few.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign
“I am saying that out of a spirit of appreciation and gratitude, and a sense of duty, you ought to make whatever adjustment is necessary to give a little of your time-as little as two years-consecrating your strength, your means, your talents to the work of sharing with others the gospel, which is the source of so much of the good that you have. I promise that if you will do so, you will come to know that what appears today to be a sacrifice will prove instead to be the greatest investment that you will ever make...”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley
