“Love gives itself; it is not bought.”  – Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, New Mission Presidents' Seminar
“Ahisma (infinite love) is a weapon of matchless potency. It is the summum bonum of life. It is an attribute of the brave, in fact it is their all. It does not come within the reach of the coward. It is no wooden or lifeless dogma but a living and lifegiving force. It is the special attribute of the soul.”  – Mahatma Gandhi, Young India
“Let us not be satisfied just by giving money. Money is not everything. Money is something you can get. The poor need the work of our hands, the love of our hearts. Love, and abundant love, is the expression of our Christian religion.”  – Mother Teresa, Young India
“Love does not just sit there, like a stone; it had to be made, like bread, remade all the time, made new.”  – Ursula Le Guin, Young India
“To be capable of steady friendship or lasting love, are the two greatest proofs, not only of goodness of heart, but of strength of mind.”  – William Hazlitt, Characteristics
“We have something that the world needs to hear about, and these [media] interviews afford an opportunity to give voice to that.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference
“When we have increased the missionaries from the organized areas of the Church to a number close to their potential, that is, every able and worthy boy in the Church on a mission; when every stake and mission abroad is furnishing enough missionaries for that country; when we have used our qualified men to help the apostles to open these new fields of labor; when we have used the satellite and related discoveries to their greatest potential and all of the media--the papers, magazines, television, radio--all in their greatest power; when we have organized numerous other stakes which will be springboards; when we have recovered from inactivity the numerous young men who are now unordained and unmissioned and unmarried; then, and not until then, shall we approach the insistence of our Lord and Master to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Spencer W. Kimball
“Radio and television waves cannot be taken hostage, captive, or be chained. They do not respect boundaries. They are free to visit every home and tell every occupant about the love of God.”  – Hannu Haukka, Spencer W. Kimball
“I suggest you grow the church from the outside in, rather than from the inside out. Start with your community, not your core! This is opposite the advice given by most books on church planting. The traditional approach to beginning a new church is to build a committed core of mature believers first, and then start reaching out to the community. The problem I have found with an 'inside-out' approach is that by the time the church planter has 'disciplined' his core, they have often lost contact with the community and are actually afraid of interacting with the unchurched. It's easy to ...[develop] such a close-knit fellowship that newcomers are afraid or unable to break into it. Too often, a core group planning a new church spends so long in the small group stage that they become comfortable with it and lose their sense of mission. The fire of evangelism dies out. The problem with most small churches is that they are all core and nothing else. The same fifty people come to everything the church does. They've all been Christians for so long they have few...unbelieving friends to witness to.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“When finances get tight in a church, often the first thing cut is the evangelism and advertising budget. That is the last thing you should cut. It is the source of new blood and life for your church.”  – Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Church
“Too many missionaries are neutralized, and occasionally lost (excommunicated), because of oversolicitous members, member sisters who 'mother' the missionaries, and socializing occurring between missionaries and members. Because of the importance of members and missionaries working effectively together on the member missionary program, it is vital that missionaries maintain the proper missionary image and have the reputation as great proselyting elders and not simply 'good guys'. The greatest help members can be to a missionary is not to feed him, but to give the names of their friends so that he can teach them with the spirit in their homes and challenge them, with the wonderful members helping to fellowship.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Mission Presidents' Seminar
“Great and magnificent as is the work of the . . . missionaries who have been set apart, I am convinced that we have a far greater force for teaching the gospel to the world in the membership of the Church-'every man a missionary'-as has been said here so convincingly tonight. 'Every man a missionary!'”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Conference Report
“I think every member of the Church has the capacity to teach the gospel to nonmembers. I was told the other day of a crippled woman, homebound, who spends her days in a wheelchair, who has been the means of bringing thirty-seven people into the Church...We need an awareness, an everyday awareness of the great power that we have to do this thing. Second, a desire. I think many of us realize that we could do it, but we lack the desire. Let every man single out another, a friend. Let him get on his knees and pray to the Lord to help him bring that man into the Church. I am as satisfied as I am of anything that with that kind of prayerful, conscientious, directed effort, there isn't a man in this Church who could not convert another...Third, the faith to try. It is so simple...This is not complex. It is simple. We have in the Northern Far East Mission of the Church today a beautiful and capable Japanese girl, born in Honolulu. I said to her, 'Were your folks members of the Church?' 'No, they were Buddhists.' 'How is it then that you are here?' She said, 'I had a high school friend who took me to Mutual once a week and then gave me a tract to read.' That girl went on to the University of Hawaii and then to Illinois Wesleyan University, from which school she was graduated. Today she is a missionary in Japan.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, Improvement Era
“Missionary work will never be what it might be without the help of the members. Stake presidents need to feel some responsibility and ownership of missionary work. The stake president is the one who has the presiding priesthood keys over both the members and non-members in his stake. The missionaries are his helpers.”  – James E. Faust, LDS Church News
“There is only one Church, and the responsibility for missionary work is universal. 'Every member a missionary.'”  – James E. Faust, LDS Church News
“...could we bring concerted action to a 'lengthening stride' movement that would bring into the missionary activity the good members of the Church the world around. The approach and the attack will need to be planned very carefully. We will need to impress upon stake, ward, and branch leaders around the globe their opportunity and responsibility. There will be need for strong, well-organized stake, ward, and district missions. It cannot be left to a mere suggestion, and a comprehensive score must be kept as a stimulant to the workers. Such a special, organized and developed program could bring many other of the blessings of the Church to more people as we have said.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar
“Several decades ago when President David O. McKay presided over the church, he gave impetus to the missionary work in the stakes of Zion. He coined the term, 'Every member a missionary,' and it is obvious that would be a giant step toward the accomplishment of our directives. Certainly we could extend our efforts and 'lengthen our stride' and greatly increase the conversions and build the kingdom and eventually knock at every door. That would only be about 2000 to every missionary, but the ratio would rapidly change if we really did this.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar
“There are two keys to productive missionary work -- (1) family-to-family friendshipping (when a member family shares the gospel with a nonmember family) and (2) cooperation between members and the missionaries to reach people...Every member knows of nonmembers he or she can refer to the missionaries. Every father, mother, and youth in this church should share the gospel by giving a Book of Mormon, telling the account of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or inviting our acquaintances to a special meeting.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar
“We expect to have complete cooperation between the stake and the full-time missionaries, and to involve the members of the Church generally in opening the gospel door to our Father's other children.”  – Spencer W. Kimball, Regional Representatives Seminar
“[When members and missionaries work together they create] 'a wonderful, cooperative relationship. Nothing will bring more joy nor increase success like that cooperative endeavor.'”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“A motto relative to relationships with ward and stake leaders is 'Ignore and you injure; inform and you inspire.'”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“If we have all the mission presidents and the stake presidents and all of the district presidencies as partners in our missionary labors, we will see the mission take off.”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“No mission will ever reach its highest potential until there is cooperation between the missionary force and the membership of the Church.”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“Of course we work hard. But the Prophet Joseph said that we must work by mental exertion and not by physical force. The referral program is such an example which brings people into the kingdom of God - through friendship and close fellowship when we work with the member organization.”  – Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church News
“Mercy among the virtues is like the moon among the stars...It is the light that hovers above the judgment seat.”  – Edwin Hubbel Chapin, LDS Church News
“Miracles do not, in fact, break the laws of nature.”  – C. S. Lewis, LDS Church News
“There is a ... group of missionaries whose names do not appear in the missionary roster, whose hours of service are not counted and whose beneficient efforts are not reported...They are the missionary hosts and hostesses -- men and women who are ministers indeed, who in denying themselves for the comfort and happiness of others are true servants of the Christ. As their Master of Old, they 'go about doing good.' These unreported missionaries are designated variously 'missionary mothers,' and 'missionary homes'...God bless the unreported missionaries in the world over whose self-denial and generous devotion to the work contribute so much to the advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”  – David O. McKay, Pathways to Happiness
“I hope that every one of you is going to be the kind of missionary that your mother thinks you are. If you are that kind of a missionary, you'll be all right. Write that in your journal and live up to it.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“There is not a home from which missionaries come that will not be enriched and blessed because of their service in the cause of the Lord. What a wonderful thing this great program is. How grateful every father and mother ought to be who has a missionary in the field. What a wonderful service it is.”  – Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church News
“Recently I reviewed the history of many missionaries and found a powerful correlation between exceptional missionaries and mothers who chose to remain home, often at great financial and personal sacrifice...They reflect honor to mothers who sacrificed to remain home for their children's benefit.”  – Richard G. Conference, General Conference
“God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers.”  – Jewish Proverb, General Conference
“All sects are different, because they come from men; morality is the same everywhere, because it comes from God.”  – Voltaire, General Conference
“When missionaries are called to serve locally, great benefits accrue to the Church in local areas. First, the missionaries can speak the language fluently so that no language training is necessary. Second, the acceptance by local people to the missionaries of their own nationality is superior to the reception received by non-nationals. Third, the great benefits which the missionaries themselves receive through their mission experience is not exported from the local area but serves to strengthen and build the kingdom in the homeland. Thus, there must be increased emphasis on the preparation of young men and women to step forward and carry the missionary responsibility in their own lands.”  – Ezra Taft Benson, Language Training Mission Groundbreaking
“Take Jacob Zundell and Frederick H. Moeser, and tell them never to drink a drop of ale, wine, or any spirit, only that which flows right out from the presence of God; and send them to Germany; and when you meet with an Arab, send him to Arabia; when you find an Italian, send him to Italy; and a Frenchman, to France; or an Indian, that is suitable, send him among the Indians. Send them to the different places where they belong. Send somebody to Central America and to all Spanish America; and don't let a single corner of the earth go without a mission.”  – Joseph Smith, Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“A little neglect may breed great mischief.”  – Benjamin Franklin, Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“It is the neglect of timely repair that makes rebuilding necessary.”  – Richard Whately, Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“He that thinks he can afford to be negligent is not far from being poor.”  – Samuel Johnson, Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith
“Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof until all of the events transpire.”  – Joseph Smith, HC
“If we don't want temptation to follow us we shouldn't act like we are interested. No one ever fell over a precipice who never went near one.”  – Richard L. Evans, HC
“Our religion is not a thing apart from our life. It is incorporated in it, and forms a part of the very tissue and sinews of our being. It provides a rule of conduct and of action for us, not only in our occasional worship but in our lives, in our work, in our play, in all that we do in the whole course of our conduct. It is this intense practicality of it that appeals to me as its greatest strength, constituting its greatest salvation for the human family.”  – Stephen L. Richards, CR
“When one has definitely eliminated those things that he will not do, then he can concentrate all of his time and energy on the things that he should do.”  – Sterling W. Sill, Ensign
“The most important human endeavor is striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depends on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to our lives.”  – Albert Einstein, Ensign
“Obedience leads to freedom. The more we obey revealed truth, the more we become liberated.”  – James E. Faust, General Conference
“'Don't you think the commandments should be rewritten?' The answer was,'No, they should be reread.'”  – Richard L. Evans, Ensign
“The commandments found in the scriptures, both the positive counsel and the 'shalt nots,' form the letter of the law. There is also a spirit of the law. We are responsible for both.”  – Boyd K. Packer, Ensign
“Those who speak of blind obedience may appear to know many things, but they do not understand the doctrines of the gospel. There is an obedience that comes from a knowledge of the truth that transcends any external form of control. We are not obedient because we are blind, we are obedient because we can see.”  – Boyd K. Packer, Ensign
“I believe that it is a hell intolerable for a people, a family or a single person, to strive to grasp truth with one hand, and error with the other, to profess to walk in obedience to the commandments of God, and, at the same time, mingle heart and hand with the wicked.”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“I have learned years ago that the Lord stands at the helm that guides Zion's ship...Unless we work exactly to the line that is marked out by him, our works will be in vain...In every branch and avenue of our lives we must learn to work to the line of truth”  – Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young
“I will here remark, that it is natural for the people to desire to know a great deal of the mysteries; this, however, is not universally the case, though it is so with a great many of the Elders of Israel. I do not suppose it will apply to those who compose this congregation; your object in being here this evening is not to hear some great mystery of the Kingdom, which you never understood before. The greatest mystery a man ever learned, is to know how to control the human mind, and bring every faculty and power of the same in subjection to Jesus Christ; this is the greatest mystery we have to learn while in these tabernacles of clay. It is more necessary for the Elders to learn and practise upon this lesson in the midst of the Saints at head quarters than in the world; for their facilities for learning are much greater, and I will tell you wherein.”  – Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses
“To [be] valiant...is to take the Lord's side on every issue.”  – Bruce R. McConkie, CR
